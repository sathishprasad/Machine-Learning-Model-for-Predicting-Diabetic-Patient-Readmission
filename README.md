# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Diabetic Patient Readmission

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our machine learning model aimed at predicting diabetic patient readmissions. This project utilizes Python and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to develop an advanced predictive model, contributing to improved patient care and reduced readmission rates.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to create and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting readmissions of diabetic patients. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes data from 130 US hospitals for the years 1999-2008. The goal is to leverage this dataset and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions about patient care and readmission risks.


1. **Download the Dataset**:

Download the diabetes dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

2. **Explore the Notebooks**:

Download the notebook and follow the step-by-step guides on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks provide a clear path to understanding and utilizing the machine learning model.

3. **Customization and Integration**:

Feel free to customize and integrate the model into your own applications or projects using the scripts provided.
